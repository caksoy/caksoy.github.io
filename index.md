I am an independent Software Developer based in Providence, Rhode Island. I obtained both my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Engineering from Bogazici University, completing my studies in 2017 and 2020, respectively. My graduate research was centered on hierarchical multitask learning for language modeling using transformers. With over seven years of experience as a Machine Learning Engineer in various corporate companies, I am currently focused on developing iOS applications.
